# catalog-server
Commercial product management server.

Catalog server is a general purpose utility server that can be used to generate a static [Product Catalog](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/product-catalog) JSON file.

Products are stored in /products/product along with product.json files that are converted to product-catalog.json.

Product management can become a problem as your product library expands. The catalog-server gives you a central place that can store all your ready-to-ship files along with useful metadata.

## Usage scenarios

- Generate a new/updated products.json [Product Catalog](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/product-catalog) file.
- Create a new product and upload it into catalog-server where it can be logged and tracked and used during new products.json generation.
